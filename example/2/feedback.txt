Let's evaluate the code according to the provided criteria:

1. **Compilation Error:**
   - There is a `return` statement outside a function or method, which will result in a syntax error.

2. **Functional Correctness:**
   - At first glance, the logic of the code seems to be sound. It's checking whether the videos can be grouped in a way such that the sum of durations in each group is equal. However, due to the aforementioned error, the program will not run successfully.

3. **Algorithm Efficiency:**
   - The code's complexity is O(n), where n is the number of videos. This is because it goes through the list of videos once.
   - This is quite efficient given the problem constraints.

4. **Conciseness:**
   - The code could be more concise by using the `input()` function and by removing unnecessary logic.

5. **Code Judgment Structure Simplification:**
   - The structure is fairly simple, but the conditions checking for the correctness of the solution can be combined to make the code more concise.

6. **Cyclomatic Complexity:**
   - This code does not contain functions. If the whole code is considered to be in a main function, the cyclomatic complexity is: V(G) = 1(if) + 1(for) + 1(if) + 1(elif) + 1(if) + 1(for) + 1 = 7, which is less than 10, so the cyclomatic complexity is small.

7. **Cognitive Complexity:**
   - The code is relatively straightforward, and the logic flows linearly. However, using more descriptive variable names and adding comments could help reduce cognitive complexity.

8. **Bad Smells:**
   - Usage of `sys.stdin.readline()` instead of `input()`.
   - Variable names like `idx` and `cur` could be more descriptive.
   - Multiple checks for the solution's correctness can be simplified.
   - Lack of comments describing the logic.

**Recommendations:**
1. Replace `sys.stdin.readline()` with `input()`.
2. Remove the `return` statements outside functions.
3. Combine conditions checking for solution correctness.
4. Add comments and improve variable naming for clarity.
